1. Understand the provided neural network architecture
2. Get familiar with provided dataset
3. comprehend the equations of forward and backward propagation
4. Load the provided dataset into a dataframe
5. Visualize the first five entries of the data frame
6. Convert the data given in the dataframe into a NumPy array
7. Query the shape of the array and assign the returned values into two variables
8. Shuffle the contents of the array
	Use numpy's shuffle array
9. Create a test set:
	Use the first 1000 images of the dataset as the test set
	Transpose the data
	Take the first row as label of the test set
	Take the remaining columns as the features of the test set
	Normalize the feature values by dividing by 255
10. Create a train set
	Use the remaining images of the dataset as the train set
	Transpose the data
	Trake the first row as the labels of the train set
	Take the remaining colums as the features of the train set
	Normalize the features value by dividing by 255

11. Generate a random index in the range dedicaed for training images
12. Plot the image corresponding to the generated index
	Use the reshape method to convert vectored image to its normal 2D form
13. Write the functions
